# ðŸ›’ Amazon Clone | HTML & CSS Only

Hey there! I'm **Rinki Senharoy**, a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student. This is my very first front-end project â€” a simple **Amazon homepage clone** built using just **HTML and CSS**. Itâ€™s also my **first GitHub project**, and Iâ€™m super excited to start my developer journey! ðŸ’»âœ¨

This project helped me understand how real-world websites like Amazon are structured on the front end. Itâ€™s beginner-friendly, clean, and made with a lot of learning and effort ðŸ’ª
